# Creation Of Web Application for Insurance Cost Prediction In USA Using Flask Framework

## Project Description: 
Welcome to the Insurance Cost Prediction Web Application! This project is a web application built using Flask, designed to predict insurance costs in the USA. By leveraging multiple linear regression modeling and evaluating the results with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared, this application aims to provide accurate and insightful predictions for insurance premiums. 

## steps of project : 

### 1.Data Preprocessing and Model Training: 
The data used for this project was preprocessed and cleaned in the data_cleaning.ipynb notebook. The Multiple Linear Regression model was trained on this cleaned dataset in the model_training.ipynb notebook. 
### 2.Building machine learning model for web application :
using multiple linear regression. 
### 3.Evaluation Metrics:
The performance of the trained model is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and effectiveness of the predictions.
### 4.Frontend Development: 
The web application's frontend was developed using HTML and CSS.
